2. Activate your virtual environment using `source /path-to-env/bin/activate`.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies for the blog.
4. Run `make serve` any time while working to start a development server.

The contents of the blog should be visible at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
