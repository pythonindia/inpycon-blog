<!--
Thanks for wanting to report an issue you've found. Please delete
this text and fill in the template below. If unsure about something, just do as
best as you're able.

Note that it will be much easier for us to fix the issue if a test case that
reproduces the problem is provided. Ideally this test case should not have any
external dependencies. We understand that it is not always possible to reduce
your code to a small test case, but we would appreciate to have as much data as
possible. Thank you!
