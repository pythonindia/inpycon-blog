Summary: Tickets for the conference are live! Grab those limited Early Bird tickets.

PyCon India is a grass-roots, volunteer-driven conference. What that means is every year for the past 12 years Python communities across the nation have come together to help plan, organize, manage, and run the conference. It's the country's largest premier conference for the Python programming language unparalleled in the opportunities, knowledge, and networking potential it fosters.
