At Atonarp, we are revolutionising how we sense, collect, process and interpret data at the
molecular level. Our teams work out of Tokyo, Bay Area and Bengaluru with a focus on scientific
technology platforms for molecular analysis.

The ability to see materials in molecular detail opens up a world of exciting possibilities. Can a
blood test be as simple as taking temperature at home? Can haemoglobin levels be measured
without the prick of a needle? With the <a href="https://www.atonarp.com/solutions/research/" target="_blank">Atonarp Optical Spectrometer (AOS)</a>, we are finding
ways to make this and much more possible. Using nonlinear optics that provide high sensitivity
and rapid results, the AOS can probe molecules without direct contact. The day isn't far when a
small wearable accessory monitors basic metabolic levels and communicates the need to see a
doctor.

We have built one of the most intelligent and user-friendly mass spectrometers in the world -
<a href="https://www.atonarp.com/" target="_blank">AMS-1300</a> - The Smart Spectrometer. Starting with <a href="https://www.atonarp.com/solutions/pharmaceutical/" target="_blank">pharmaceutical lyophilisation</a>, we now
enable powerful process analytical solutions across a range of industries - <a href="https://www.atonarp.com/solutions/semiconductors/" target="_blank">Semiconductors</a> and
<a href="https://www.atonarp.com/solutions/oil-natural-gas/" target="_blank">Petrochem</a> . We use data science - statistical modelling, noise characterization, machine
learning and data analytics - to provide accurate measurements at a fraction of the cost of
traditional equipment.

Come join our team of physicists, data scientists, and opto-mechanical, hardware & software
engineers and make it happen! Take a look at our <a href="https://www.atonarp.com/careers/" target="_blank">current openings</a> and write to us.
