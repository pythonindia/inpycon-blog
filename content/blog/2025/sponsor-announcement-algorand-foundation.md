Algorand's mission is to power a world where information has integrity and innovative ideas can scale. The Algorand Foundation champions this with a best-in-class developer environment, vital infrastructure support, comprehensive technical standards, and extensive resources across a rapidly growing ecosystem.

Algorand believes that Python deserves first-class blockchain support. That's precisely why it empowers developers to build directly with native languages like Python and TypeScript. Its community is already solving critical global challenges across payments, real-world asset tokenization (RWAs), DeFi, supply chain, decentralized identity, and beyond.
