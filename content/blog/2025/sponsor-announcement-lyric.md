Lyric develops an enterprise AI platform for supply chains, utilized by Fortune 500 companies such as Coca-Cola and Est√©e Lauder. Their offerings include decision applications for forecasting, allocation, capacity, order promising, and what-if scenarios, as well as a composable platform that enables teams to build solutions using no-code methods or their own code.

Python is integral to their platform, powering their data fabric, ML/forecasting, optimization, and GenAI copilots, leveraging libraries like FastAPI, Pydantic, Pandas/Polars, PyTorch, and Ray. They combine pragmatic engineering with first-principles modeling to deliver trusted and explainable outcomes, rather than just dashboards.

Lyric is participating in PyCon India to connect with builders and the community. Attendees are invited to visit their booth for live demos, discussions with their engineers, and swags!!. Lyric is actively recruiting for backend, data/ML, and product roles.
