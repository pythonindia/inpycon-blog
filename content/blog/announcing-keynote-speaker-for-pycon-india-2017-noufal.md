The story of [Noufal Ibrahim](http://nibrahim.net.in/) and PyCon goes way back to the first ever PyCon India Conference. PyCon India 2009 was the first Python Conference in our country and it would not have been possible without Noufal and a group of dedicated volunteers.

He founded [Hamon](https://hamon.in/about/) and worked for Cisco systems, Synopsys, The Internet Archive and other organisations mostly in infrastructure engineering positions. Noufal is also a trainer and loves to help people out on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/229602/noufal-ibrahim). Apart from this he has a collection of [calligraphy](http://calligraffiti.in/) sheets on this website which he maintains to be beautiful.
