Summary: PyCon India releases its schedule and details for the 2-day diversity and inclusion track happening this year!

Diversity and Inclusion have been our utmost priority. To make the conference more accessible we had taken a series of constructive steps to build an inclusive space for all. Promoting the sharing of knowledge and diverse insights by the community without inhibitions and still managing to keep 6 feet apart. 

As per our [mission statement](https://in.pycon.org/blog/2019/2019-making-pycon-india-women-friendly.html), we would like to ensure that the conference approaches everyone with respect and that we resolve differences peacefully. In particular, we will proactively extend our invite to women, provide support for students, and ensure that people with disabilities feel welcome at the conference.

This year as the conference goes online, we worked towards adding Diversity and Inclusion as its own track at the conference. We came up with a series of carefully picked up experience sharing sessions by women established in their fields - talking about their journeys and experiences to reach where they are currently. The categories for these sessions are as follows:

## Day 1 - 2nd October

- Category 1: Women leading successful communities within India | 13:30 - 14:00
- Category 2: Women in Leadership Roles | 14:00 - 14:30
- Category 3: Women rejoining workforce after long career break | 18:00 - 18:30
- Category 4: Women student doing great | 18:30 - 19:00

## Day 2 - 3rd October

- Category 5: Women in Entrepreneurship | 13:30 - 14:00
- Category 6: Women who transitioned career from non-tech to tech field | 14:00 - 14:30
- Category 7: Women in Research | 15:20 - 15:50
- Category 8: Open Source contribution and opportunities | 18:00 - 18:30
- Category 9: Tech conferences and grants | 18:30 - 19:00

Alongside these, we have the traditional PyLadies India Lunch happening on Day 1 (14:30-15:15) - online of course! Experience sharing sessions and PyLadies India Lunch will be happening in the PyLadies Booth. Also, on top of this, we have two other sessions focusing on Diversity and Inclusion happening between 18:00 - 19:00 on both days. The topics for these two sessions include:

- The importance of 'unconscious bias' awareness for Diversity and Inclusion
- The importance of Diversity and Inclusion for Algorithmic Bias Considerations

More information about the schedule, talks, and speaker details can be found in the [document](https://bit.ly/PyConIndia20_DiversityAndInclusion) or on the Hopin Calendar. We hope to see you all there!
