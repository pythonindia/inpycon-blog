Summary: Our plan to give attendees more opportunities to speak at PyCon India 2020.

### Submissions this year

As you know, PyCon India 2020 is going online this year. With the current situation, the team wanted to take the unique opportunity to make our conference bigger, more inclusive, and much more accessible to our attendees all over the world. We received an oustanding response to the event, with a total of 243 talks submissions under 12 primary domains.

### Difficult decision to choose amongst so many remarkable proposals

We got many excellent talks this year, but we had limited slots available for the conference. So, we had to reject a lot of great talks. The review team had to consider various factors while selecting the talks, including a proper mix of beginner and advanced topics, providing an opportunity for first-time speakers, diversity, etc.

### Adding an additional track to the conference

PyCon India 2020, over the last few years, has been a three-track event. Seeing the quality of the talks, the team decided to add an additional track for the event this year.

So, PyCon India 2020 will be a four-track event. This would mean the event would have even more amazing speakers presenting their exceptional talks at the conference. The talks would range from beginner to advanced and cover a wide range of computer science topics.

### The motivation behind a track for rejected talks

We believe that no talks are worthy of being rejected anywhere. And, with that ideology comes the concept of a rejects conference/track. We are highly inspired from the [Cloud Native Rejekts](https://cloud-native.rejekts.io/) conducted every year, giving a second chance to the wonderful but rejected talks from another Cloud Native conference.

That motivation led us to initiate a 5th track of the conference dedicated to the rejected talks from the other 4 tracks. The idea is by no means to undermine the value of a talk given by anyone. All of the tracks are equal to our eyes and we expected the attendees to feel the same.

### How is this track different from a usual track?

The track is similar to the other 4 tracks. The only difference between the 5th track and the other 4 tracks is that a review committee doesn't do the selection, but a raffle will select and schedule the talks. Any talk proposer who is attending the conference, irrespective of their talk being selected to the usual tracks or not, has an opportunity to speak at the conference.

This initiative is not a separate conference but is entirely a part of the PyCon India 2020 event. The track will be scheduled in parallel to all the other items in the conference schedule. The talks will be delivered through the same channels as the other tracks. The talks will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube after the conference, along with the other talks and workshops.

### What are we doing going forward?

We headed out to set the ground for that track by naming it `refusals.py`, but through attendees' reviews, we got a feeling that the name `refusals.py` is not going down well. People are not very comfortable by the name, although there is considerable interest in the track. This made us rethink the approach throughout the day. After considering all the responses, the team decided to name the 5th track `.extend()` signifying our idea and initiatives of including as many talks as we can. We hope that the community considers this change to be in a positive direction.

We would encourage all the attendees whose talks couldn't be selected fill in their interest to speak at the event. All proposers have already been sent a link to form for the same.

Looking forward to seeing you at the conference!
