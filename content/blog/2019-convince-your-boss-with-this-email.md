Summary:Save time composing an email to convince your boss to send you to PyCon India. We got you covered.

There are a gazillion things to be gained attending PyCon India. Unfortunately, it takes time to sit and compose a neat little email to send to your boss enumerating them. Now consider that atleast half of our attendees attempt to do that, we would lose so many hours of productivity reinventing the wheel ;) . So PyCon India is here to save the day. We have composed a "Convince The Boss" letter to save you time. Of course, feel free to edit it as you like, remove some, add some or use as is. 

## Important Notes
1. You do not need to keep all the points. Remove ones you deem unnecessay. The shorter it is, the better the chances that your boss will read it.

2. Watchout for the `{TEMPLATE_VARIABLES}`. You need to replace them with information relevant to you. Don't let them escape you.

## The Letter

Dear `{BOSSNAME}`,

I am excited to brief you about PyCon India, India's premier conference on using and developing the Python programming language that takes place in Chennai from October 12-15, 2019. About a 1000+ of the industry's Pythonistas from different fields are bound to be in attendance for the 11th edition of this mega event.

It would be great if I get an opportunity to attend this conference as there will be innumerable benefits for me as an individual which will in turn impact the organization as well. To list a few:

* `{OPTIONAL}` I am particularly keen on attending this `{TALK/WORKSHOP/DEVSPRINT}` on `{TOPIC}` presented by `{SPEAKER-NAME}` as our `{PROJECT/UPCOMING PROJECT}` is based on this. 

* Exposure to the actionable best practices & tools that we could use in our projects, saving money and time spent exploring different options.

* Provides a forum to get a sneak peek at upcoming innovations.

* Provides a platform to unmask the rationality behind the trending technologies like ML/AI, Automation, Web development, Software development, IOT and more that use Python.

* Learning technologies from a wide array of talks, workshops, keynotes speech, developer sprints each presented by inspiring and enthusiastic industry experts, community leaders and many young minds delving into new technologies.

* Opportunity to network with like-minded people from diverse backgrounds including geek programmers, enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, scholars, intellectuals and many more.

* A chance to spread the word about our company and create goodwill about the opportunities and incentives the employees are given. This will be the ideal way to attract future employees from an diversified talent pool.

* `{OPTIONAL}` As a `{WOMAN/PERSON WITH VISUAL DIFFICULTIES, etc}`, attending the conference will also demonstrate to the tech community that our company takes diversity in our workforce very seriously. Innovative thinking and better products come from teams that are diverse covering more ground.

There is an Early Bird ticket offer on for the first 300 tickets sold before 30th June 2019 and it costs only Rs 1100. Booking later (or after the first 300 tickets) would cost Rs 1600. The tickets include access to all PyCon India keynotes & talks, sponsor showcase, community spaces, an official PyCon India T-shirt along with lunch and high-tea in the evening for both days (12th-13th October).

I would be happy to write a post-conference report detailing what I've learnt and to recommend any changes that we could implement to improve our practices. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I hope we make use this opportunity for the benefit of our company.

Thank you,

`{YOURNAME}`
