If you have a topic in mind that you think is worth presenting, then do put it
down by all means. However, just in case you are looking for topics to think
about, here are a few:

* Core Python
* Data Analytics
* Artificial Intelligence
* Internet of Things
* Web Development
* Mobile Application Development
* Security
* Scientific Computing
* Network Programming
* Game Programming
* Infrastructure
* Automation

As we said in the opening statement, and our announcement post, we encourage
people from all walks of life to submit proposals. Fight the impostor syndrome,
and put in a draft anyway. You can flesh it out over time with the help of your
friends and our reviewers.
