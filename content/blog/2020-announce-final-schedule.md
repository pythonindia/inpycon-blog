Summary: PyCon India 2020 releases its schedule this time having 4 tracks packed to the brim with amazing talks and 6 keynotes for its next online iteration this year!

2020 has been a rollercoaster for all of us. Our team had setbacks, we pushed through them, and what a ride it has been for all of us helping to make PyCon India 2020 a huge success.

The sheer amount of proposals we received from you all over the last couple of days exceeded all our wildest expectations. The review committee along with all the volunteers worked quite hard to make the deadlines work. The schedule has been released a day before the deadline which signals us that we are on track as we move forward according to the plan. All these efforts go on to accomplish one outcome. An awesome PyCon India keeping you at its epicenter!

As we are releasing the talk and keynotes schedule, be sure to look out for the release of workshops and information about many more events in the coming days on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pyconindia) and on [our mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon). Our rehearsal team is working double-time to get all the speakers in top shape for making this year's PyCon India experience amazing for everyone.
