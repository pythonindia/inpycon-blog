While the preparations are under full swing to celebrate the 10th year
anniversary edition of PyCon India and make the event a grand success, here's a
chance for you and your organisation to make it even better!

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

The entire organising team and the community at large are extremely thankful to
all the sponsors who have supported us throughout out the years. It is no secret
that without your support, we wouldn't have been able to even think about taking
the conference to bigger and better heights with each and every year. Many of
you must already be eager to come forward and book your slot, but here's a bit
more information and incentive so as to why you should consider sponsoring:

Put your business in the spot light
***********************************

Stand out among the attendees by prominently displaying your products and
marketing material.

Low Cost Marketing
******************

Instead of spending a fortune on traditional advertisements, take a look at our
reasonably priced sponsorship slabs and pick one - letting you be discovered and
known to the cream of the community at maybe half (or even less!) of your
marketing budget.

Hiring
******

The conference has a history of attracting smart folks from various backgrounds
and also of making matches between them and potential employers. Get connected,
make your pitch and find the best programmers to join your ranks!

Give Back to the Community
**************************

Establish your goodwill and show the community that you’re a reliable partner,
willing to support the ecosystem. Sponsorship is a way of giving back to the
community and thanking them for their support. Your sponsorship helps PyCon
India remain affordable and accessible to the widest possible audience.

Small Business Discount
***********************

To make PyCon India affordable to small businesses and startups, we provide a
50% discount for the Gold, Silver and Associate sponsorship slabs. Note: In
order to avail this discount, your organization must have been established not
more than two years ago, with fewer than 10 current employees.

Flexibility
***********

Have something specific in mind? Please don’t hesitate to ask! We are more than
happy to work with you and tailor sponsorship benefits to suit your needs.
