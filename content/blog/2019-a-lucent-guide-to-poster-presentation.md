Hello Pythonistas, in this blog, we will discuss about posters and walk you through the process of making a great poster presentation at PyCon India 2019.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

### What is a Poster?

Posters are graphical summary of projects or ideas. They are usually presented with an A0 size poster, but any creative ways are always welcome. The poster session provides an opportunity to network with the conference attendees and acts as a starting point for further discussions. While talks generally need to appeal to a wide section of the community, posters can cover niche topics.

PyCon India 2019 will be having a poster presentation session at post lunch, day 1 (12 October 2019). During the poster presentation session you will be provided with a poster board that can hold an A0 size poster, and a table to place your laptop, for demos. Conference attendees interested in your topic, will stop by, during which you can give them a brief presentation / demo.

First, ensure that you select a good title. Conference attendees will use it to determine which posters to attend. Make sure it brings in audience who will be interested in your poster. 

Second, for the poster itself, here are a few tips for creating the poster: 
* While textual representation is good, graphical representation will attract more eyes 
* Make sure the contents are properly sized and spaced in the poster so that it is viewable from decent distance 
* Provoke the reader's curiosity which will open up space for further discussions 
* Provide links for the attendees to know more about the topic and connect with you / the community 

You can refer to the following real poster presentation proposals for inspirations.
