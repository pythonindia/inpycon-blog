You can always contact our mentors on Zulip. You can join them on the [PyCon India Zulip Channel](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/#) and drop a text in the [pre-cfp topic](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/245487-wg.2Fmentorship/topic/pre-cfp) of the #Mentorship stream (Streams are available to choose from the sidebar on the left). 

### Open Mentorship calls 

In the hopes of providing better opportunities and assistance for first-time speakers at PyCon India 2020, we are starting weekly mentorship calls. This would be an open call for participants and potential speakers to interact with PyCon India mentors to review, share, and discuss draft proposals. Details of the call are as follows:

* **Date:** Weekly on Saturdays

* **Time:** 15:00 to 17:00 IST

* **Platform:** Google Meet - Join with the [invite link](https://meet.google.com/pot-jzjq-udn)

This way you can interact with the mentorship team instantly and clear out queries on a more real-time basis.

### Reviewing Proposals

Whichever platform you choose to opt for interacting with the mentors, you would be asked to share a Google document with comment access to a mentor, who will then review and help you polish the draft. If you don't get any response in 48 hours, please send a direct message to @siddharthvipul on Zulip. And that’s all you need to do. 

Hope this helps in the process of framing a proposal and make it easier for you to apply for a talk at PyCon India. After all, PyCon India is a community-driven event and our foremost priority is to help you learn and grow. So, keep your worries aside and just keep on submitting them proposals. If you need any help, we are just a text away!

P.S. Looking forward to reading your proposal.
