Summary: Make your first contribution to open source at PyCon India 2023 DevSprints

PyCon India 2023 is the perfect place to get started with contributing to open-source projects. We are organizing DevSprints on 2nd October 2023.

## What are DevSprints?

[Devsprints](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/devsprint-2023/proposals/) are a whole-day event organized at PyCon India 2023 to promote open-source contribution and bring more people into the open-source community.

**Are you interested in making your first open-source contribution? Or are you a seasoned contributor looking to help out others? Then Devsprints is the place for you!** At Devsprints, active contributors of open-source projects are there to guide you through the process of making your very first open-source contribution. Right from setting up the build environments, to developing and testing code, to submitting patches for bugs and features. If you are stuck anywhere, the mentors and your fellow contributors will be right there to help you figure out issues and resolve them as best as they can! Many participants have started their open-source journey at PyCon India DevSprints and have gone on to become regular contributors to various open-source projects.

## Who can participate?

***You!*** Whether you're a seasoned contributor or just starting, the DevSprints at PyCon India 2023 are the perfect opportunity to get to work. Our mentors will be on hand to provide instant help whenever you need it, so you can keep moving forward. It is a great opportunity to get accustomed to the ways of the open-source and contribute to the projects you love.

## When and Where?

**After the conference, we will be organizing DevSprints on 2nd October 2023. The DevSprints will be held at [Phenom People Pvt Ltd, Whitefield, Kondapur.](https://goo.gl/maps/hmHBapTF6bMNJWWx5)**

The timings for the DevSprints will be from 09:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

### How to participate?

You do not need any additional tickets to participate in the Devsprints. Any person with a valid Conference ticket is free to attend devsprints. However, the capacity of the venue is limited, up to a maximum of 200 participants. Entry will be permitted on a first come first serve basis at the Venue.

## Looking for new Contributors for your project?

If you're a contributor or maintainer of an open-source project, we invite you to mentor your project in the PyCon India 2023 DevSprints. Ideally, you should have a history with the project through previous code commits. You will help new contributors set up their development environment, list out good first issues that new contributors can easily get started with, and guide folks on any problems they face during the event.

### How to add your Project?

You can head over to [Devsprints CFP](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/devsprint-2023/proposals/) and submit your proposal.

**Any maintainer is welcome to add a project. There will be no shortlisting of projects. We are using the CFP platform to make it easier to manage and keep the projects in one place.**
