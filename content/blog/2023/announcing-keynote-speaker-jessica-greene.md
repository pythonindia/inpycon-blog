Summary: We are happy to announce **Jessica Greene (she/her)** as a Keynote Speaker for PyCon India 2023!

Jessica Greene is a self-taught slash community-taught Software Engineer, with a diverse background that includes film, television, and specialty coffee roasting. In 2017, she made the pivotal decision to retrain and add programming to her skill set, leading her to join the team at Ecosia in 2018. In her role, she leverages her Python and Golang skills to build and operate APIs, perform data analysis, and develop features that inspire users to make more climate-focused choices, thereby contributing to Ecosia's mission of global tree planting and a better planet.

Passionate about fostering diversity and inclusivity in tech, Jessica has been co-organizing PyLadies Berlin since 2018. She orchestrates events, workshops, and talks, and provides mentorship to other programmers. Recently, she joined the Python Software Foundation's Code of Conduct Work Group to further support the global community.

When she's not coding or at community events, Jessica enjoys reading, building Lego kits, knitting, dog-sitting, and exploring new aspects of software engineering.
