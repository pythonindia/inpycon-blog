Summary: Make PyCon India accessible to more people with your contribution

**PyCon India 2023** is introducing a novel initiative through its **Contributor tickets**, embodying the spirit of community and collaboration. Open to all, these tickets serve as a means for individuals to not only participate in the current conference but also to contribute to the sustainability and inclusivity of future editions. By purchasing a Contributor ticket, attendees secure their place for two enriching days of the conference.

This innovative approach holds a dual purpose:

- First, by investing in a Contributor ticket, attendees directly aid the conference organizers in sponsoring tickets for those who might otherwise be unable to attend due to financial constraints.
- Second, these contributions facilitate the provision of discounted tickets to students, nurturing the next generation of Python enthusiasts.

*The PyCon India Contributor tickets stand as a testament to the community's dedication to knowledge-sharing, accessibility, and the fortification of PyCon India's legacy for years to come.*
