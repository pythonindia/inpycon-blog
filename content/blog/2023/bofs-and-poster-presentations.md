Summary: We're bringing back the community favorite **Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions** and **Poster Presentations** at PyCon India 2023. Read on to know more about these sessions and how you can participate.

### Birds of a Feather (BoF) Sessions: Embracing Open Discussions

<br/>

Much like the vibrant diversity of bird species, PyCon India showcases the beauty of '**Birds of a Feather**' – where Python enthusiasts from various backgrounds gather to discuss their common passions or interests without a pre-planned agenda. BoFs are a space to exchange ideas, share personal experiences, and learn from one another in a relaxed and inclusive atmosphere. They provide a platform for lighthearted discussions and deep dives into technical subjects alike.  

BoF sessions last an hour and are a delightful mix of seriousness and fun. BoFs can be serious, and a great way to gather the people from the community in a common space to deep dive on a topic, but they can also bring opportunities to learn while having a lot of fun! At this year's conference, we will be having a specially planned BoF on Python IDE’s.

If you're passionate about something you like to share and explore with the community, why not propose a BoF session? As a moderator, you'll guide the discussion, ensuring everyone's voice is heard.

- BoF Session CFP closes: **19th August 2023**

### Poster Presentation Sessions: Visualizing Ideas, Fostering Connections

<br/>

#### Are you excited about showcasing a Python project, idea, or concept?

PyCon India 2023 is bringing you a creative avenue for just that with **Poster Presentation sessions**. These sessions are a canvas for creativity, covering everything from hardware projects to niche topics.  

PyCon India 2023 will be having a Poster Presentation session **on both conference days** in the **second half - Between the second and third Keynote**. During the poster presentation session, you will be provided with a poster board that can hold an A0 size poster, and a table to place your laptop, for demos. Conference attendees interested in your topic will stop by, during which you can give them a brief presentation/demo.  

#### What makes a good poster?

Here are a few tips for creating the poster:

- Ensure that you select a good title. Conference attendees will use it to determine which posters to attend.
- While textual representation is good, graphical representation will attract more eyes
- Make sure the contents are properly sized and spaced in the poster so that it is viewable from decent distance
- Provoke the reader's curiosity which will open up space for further discussions
- Provide links for the attendees to know more about the topic and connect with you / the community
