Summary: Want to give back to the Python community? Here’s an awesome opportunity for you to do it with the year's premier Python conference, **PyCon India 2023**.

[PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/2023/) is a grass-roots, volunteer-driven conference. What that means is every year for the past 14 years, Python communities across the nation have come together to help plan, organize, manage, and run the conference. The conference is operated entirely by volunteers from planning to finding the speakers to managing call for proposals to handling the mega event successfully without fail.

## Things to Know Before Volunteering

Before you dive into the exciting world of volunteering for PyCon India 2023, here are some important points to keep in mind:

- Volunteering requires a significant amount of time and effort. Some tasks, such as running outreach and social media, building content, and finding speakers, demand more commitment than others. Make sure you can allocate sufficient time to your volunteering efforts.

- While volunteering, you may be occupied with tasks during conference sessions, which means you might miss attending those sessions. Being available to assist others is crucial. Plan your conference schedule accordingly.

- Volunteering does not provide free access to the event. At PyCon India, everyone, including organizers, needs to purchase a ticket. We volunteer because we are passionate about the Python programming language and the community, and we want to contribute to making this event exceptional.

## Benefits of Volunteering

You might be wondering what you'll gain from helping us make the conference better. Besides having a say in the conference's decisions and direction, there are numerous benefits to volunteering:

- **Networking**: You'll have the opportunity to meet exceptional individuals, including recognized experts in their fields. Additionally, you'll interact with Python enthusiasts, developers, and contributors to various open-source communities. This networking can provide valuable insights and foster new collaborations.

- **Practical Experience**: Volunteering at PyCon India offers hands-on experience in event management, teamwork, and the open-source development ecosystem. You'll gain insights into large-scale, real-life projects and become a vital part of the machinery behind community events. Working alongside talented individuals can provide invaluable learning opportunities.
