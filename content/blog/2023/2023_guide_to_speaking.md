	-  **Outline the talk's objectives**: Clearly outline what participants can expect from your session and what they will learn from attending your talk. Describe the issue you intend to address and the potential solutions or insights you intend to provide.

	-  **Provide an outline or structure**: Give a brief overview of the talk's structure, including the key points or sections you will cover. This helps in demonstrating a well-organized presentation.

	-  **Be authentic**: Share real life practical examples, use cases, or projects that demonstrate the application of the concepts you plan to discuss. This helps the reviewers see the tangible benefits of your talk. Try to include personal experiences in order to connect with the audience.

	-  **Iterate and seek feedback**: Before submitting your CFP, seek feedback from your colleagues or friends. Incorporate their suggestions and iterate on your proposal to make it stronger.
