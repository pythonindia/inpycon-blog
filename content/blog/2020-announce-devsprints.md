Summary: Announcing the PyCon India 2020 devsprints 


PyCon India 2020 is THE place for developers from across the country and beyond to gather and celebrate Python. But what good is a PyCon without getting your hands dirty writing some code? Hence, for all open-source enthusiasts out there, the PyCon India team is happy to announce Devsprints @ PyCon India 2020.

## What is a Devsprint?

During **Devsprints**, mentors/contributors of popular OSS projects guide participants through the end-to-end process of an OSS contribution. Right from setting up the build environments, to developing and testing code, to submitting patches for bugs and features. If you are stuck anywhere, mentors will be available right on the stream to help you figure out issues and resolve them as best as they can! From past experiences, weâ€™ve seen a lot of people start off contributing to FOSS through PyCon India Devsprints and later go on to become regular contributors to various projects across the web.

## When and Where? Are Devsprints really free?

Devsprints will be conducted online on 4th and 5th October 2020 on the Hopin.to conference platform. The [Devsprints tickets](https://in.pycon.org/2020/#ticket) are free of charge and limited in number as slots for the devsprint are limited. Please make sure to grab yours when they are released if you are looking to kickoff your FOSS journey right!

## Need Contributors for your project?

If you are a contributor or have been involved in the maintenance of any Python-based open-source projects, please come forward and add your project to the PyCon India Devsprints. Ideally, you should have a history with the project through previous code commits. Your responsibility will be to help new contributors set up their development environment, list out beginner-friendly bugs, and guide folks on any problems they face during the event.
