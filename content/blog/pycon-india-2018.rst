**This blog post is old. There has been a change in PyCon India 2018 Location. The Announcement can be found in this** `blog post <https://in.pycon.org/blog/2018/pycon-india-2018-reschedule.html>`_.

A decade of unity in diversity presents - the 10th year anniversary edition of
PyCon India!

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

While a walk down memory lane would be apt at this point, let's keep the long
story short for now by saying we've done it! A conference started by volunteers,
handed and taken over from one group to another, from one city to another, we
start drawing another arc of the full circle this year when the conference
reaches back to its city of origin - Bangalore.

Dates
-----

The Conference will be from August 22nd (Wednesday) to 26th (Sunday).

- Conference  : 22nd (Wed) - 24th (Fri)
- Workshop    : 25th (Sat) - 26th (Sun)
- Dev sprints : 25th (Sat) - 26th (Sun)

Venue
-----

We're moving to an even bigger and better venue this year - The Bangalore
International Exhibition Centre. It can take in a lot more people, has more
halls for multiple tracks, allows for easier movement between them and is
generally a whole lot bigger than all the other venues we've had so far.

As you might have guessed, the discussions and preparations are under full swing
already. While the conference along with the participation has evolved and grown
significantly over the years, none of that would've happened had we not pushed
to excel ourselves every single year. With that spirit, and a whole lot of
energy, let's look at a few things we're introducing this year.

Kids' Track
-----------

There hasn't been a better time in history for the young ones to learn and play
with programming. With an eye into the future, this year we intend to have a
dedicated Kids' Track where we welcome them, teach and let them build stuff over
the days of the conference.

Poster Sessions
---------------

While we already had Poster Sessions once before, it was only for a short 30
minutes. Since it was received very well, we're planning to have it again this
year; probably with more time and incentive for the presenters to get involved.

Career Booth
------------

This is exclusively to help potential job seekers to find an opportunity at the
conference. The idea is to have a dedicated booth/stall to collect resumes and
contact information of those who want to get discovered by potential employers
and make a match between them. The finer details are yet to be finalised, but
we've received requests for the something of the sort over the years and we're
sure it'll help quite a few people.

That's about it for now!

In case your organisation is interested in meeting one of the most enthusiastic
Python crowds in all of India, be sure to checkout the sponsorship details. Not
only would you have access to meet these people face to face, but you will be
helping the community as a whole by supporting the conference financially and
making sure we can accommodate the widest possible audience.

For you budding speakers and teachers out there, prepare yourself mentally and
watch this space for the Call For Proposal announcement. We want to see your
proposals and we encourage people from all walks of life to submit talk/workshop
proposals despite your age, gender, experience and/or background. No one became
an expert overnight. So seize the opportunity and let's get you on that stage.

Now the question is...

Are **you** ready?
