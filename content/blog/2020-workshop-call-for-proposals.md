The [call for proposals](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2020/proposals/) for workshops has been officially opened! If you are slight to moderately unsure of submitting a workshop proposal, you won't be after reading this.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->
Here's a question for you.
Do you think that you would be able to assemble 3 hours of material and lead an online session full of PyCon attendees through learning a new skill, library, or technology? Then you might be someone we are looking for. Apply to host your workshop at PyCon India 2020! PyCon India 2020 workshops will be held online on October 4th, 2020.

As with the talks, we are looking for workshops that can grow this community at any level. We aim for workshops that will advance Python, advance this community, and shape the future. Each workshop runs for 3 full hours plus a break for coffee. As workshops are longer, more in-depth than talks, they require much more preparation. Much more when it comes to writing your proposal.

## Guide to writing amazing proposals

As you think about your experiences, skills, and knowledge that you would want to bring to the table. We also want you to focus on the proposal that you will be submitting to us. A well thought out propsoal means everything here at this point. Take your time to go through our team's advice on preparing a kickass proposal that turns heads (virtually):

When submitting a proposal for a workshop, you would need to fill the following details.

## Title
Give your workshop a name that accurately describes the workshop's focus to potential attendees.

## Description
A brief description of the workshop. Guide the reader through your plans for the workshop. Also, provide a timeline if possible.

## Audience Level
At what level of Python and other topic-specific experience or expertise is the workshop aiming for? We realize this may be too narrow for a workshop, for example if the workshop is aimed at experienced programmers but novices to Python, but give it your best shot. Reviewers need to know what level of Python experience is targeted and also what level(s) of domain-specific expertise is targeted, for example networking, SQL, database, etc.

## Prerequistes
Preferences or requirements if any in regards to your workshop.

## Video URL
With PyCon India 2020 being online this year, we are introducing preview videos to our proposal submission workflow. **Preview videos** are you talking about your proposal, topics you intend to cover in the workshop, and how you intend to cover them. Participants are strongly suggested to upload links of their preview videos while submitting their proposals. It will be immensely helpful for reviewers to go through preview videos and take that into account before making final decisions on your workshop proposal. Please keep in mind to strictly follow all guidelines for creating your video preview as [mentioned here](https://in.pycon.org/blog/2020/2020-call-for-proposals-announcement.html).

## Speaker Info
You'll be asked to enter your biography and the information will be made public. Here, you may wish to include more information for reviewers to complement information about your previous experience. This can include your subject matter experience, past workshops if any, past speaking events if any or anything else that would help us understand and gauge your abilities as a workshop presenter. Ideal would be a link to a video (To be added in Speaker URL's)


The workshop selection process attempts to choose a good variety of workshop topics and levels that will be in demand, i.e., it doesn't just select the best proposals! The selection process has also tended to prefer Python-related topics over more general software development tools or practices that aren't Python-specific.


## Where to submit your proposal
