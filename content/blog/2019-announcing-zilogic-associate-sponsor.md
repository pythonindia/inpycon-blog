Zilogic Systems is a product-realization company specializing in embedded technologies. We cater to Embedded platforms, IoT, Automotive and Wireless industries. We are a single source for hardware, firmware, system software, application software and test automation engineering expertise.

Instituted in 2007, we have been serving the industry for more than a decade. Over the years, we have nurtured the use of open source software in embedded systems, which historically has been dominated by proprietary software tools. We contribute by submitting patches to poular open source projects, releasing software and tools under open source licenses, and by running workshops and meetups related to Linux in embedded systems.
