Episource has devoted more than a decade in building solutions for risk adjustment to measure
healthcare outcomes. As one of the leading companies in healthcare, we have helped numerous
clients optimize their medical records, data, analytics to enable better documentation of care for
patients with chronic diseases.

The backbone of our consistent success has been our obsession with data and technology. At
Episource, all of our strategic initiatives start with the question - how can data be "deployed"?
Our analytics platforms and datalakes ingest huge quantities of data daily, to help our clients
deliver services. We have also built our own machine learning and NLP platform to infuse added
productivity and efficiency into our workflow. Combined, these build a foundation of tools and
practices used by quantitative staff across the company.

What's our poison you ask? We work with most of the popular frameworks and technologies like
Spark, Airflow, Ansible, Terraform, Docker, ELK. For machine learning and NLP, we are big fans of
keras, spacy, scikit-learn, pandas and numpy. AWS and serverless platforms help us stitch these
together to stay ahead of the curve.

We are always hiring strong talent who believe in the vision to use technology to make an impact.
