ThoughtWorks is a community of passionate individuals whose purpose is to revolutionize software design, creation, and delivery while advocating for positive social change. There are over 5,000 ThoughtWorkers in 14 countries, and we're growing fast in every region of the world.

We work with people and organizations who have ambitious missions - whether they are in the commercial, social or government sectors. Our Agile development tools help our clients continuously improve and deliver quality software. We are focused on helping our industry improve, and believe in sharing what we learn. We do this by writing books, blogging, hosting tech events, speaking at conferences, and championing open source software.

We're looking for change makers. Opportunity creators. Bridge builders. Mind openers. Status-quo shakers. Together, we'll create a place where people have the freedom to make a real and positive impact on our world through technology.

Our mission is to better humanity through software and help drive the creation of a socially and economically just world. We bring together the most capable, driven and passionate people - we call them 'ThoughtWorkers' - to:
<ol>
<li> Run a sustainable business.</li>
<li> Champion software excellence and revolutionize the IT industry.</li>
<li> Advocate passionately for social and economic justice.</li>
</ol>
