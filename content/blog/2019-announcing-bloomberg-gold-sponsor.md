Bloomberg is building the world's most trusted information network for financial professionals. Our 5,500+ engineers are dedicated to advancing and building new systems for the Bloomberg Terminal to solve complex, real-world problems. We trust our teams to choose the right technologies for the job, and, at Bloomberg, the answer is often Python. We employ an active community of more than 2,000 Python developers who have their hands in everything from financial analytics and data science to contributing to open source technologies like Project Jupyter. We also sponsor and host many events for the Python community.

Asia-Pacific is one of the company's fastest-growing regions and we have been expanding our Engineering presence in the region to support our clients. Bloomberg's Engineering office in Pune was established in 2014. Over the last couple of years, headcount in the office has grown and the number of teams working there has doubled. These software engineering teams work on many critical business areas, including asset, investment, and portfolio management software, as well as exchange trading connectivity software. An ever-increasing number of their projects are being undertaken exclusively in Python.
