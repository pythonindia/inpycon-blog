Hi Everyone, it's our pleasure to announce the PyCon India 2018’s silver sponsor FOSSEE.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

[FOSSEE](https://fossee.in/)(Free and Open Source Software in Education) project promotes the use of FOSS tools to improve the quality of education in our country. We aim to reduce dependency on proprietary software in educational institutions. We encourage the use of FOSS tools through various activities such as Textbook Companions, Lab Migration, Workshops, Conferences, Forums, Software Development and Others. We also develop and upgrade existing tools to meet the requirements in academia and research.

The FOSSEE project is based at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) and is funded by the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Ministry of Human Resources and Development, Government of India.
