Hi Everyone, it is our pleasure to announce Corteva Agriscience, as PyCon India 2018’s gold sponsor.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Corteva Agriscience&trade;, the agriculture division of DowDuPont&trade;, is the only major agriscience
company completely dedicated to agriculture. By combining the strengths of DuPont Pioneer,
DuPont Crop Protection and Dow AgroSciences, we've harnessed agriculture's brightest minds
and expertise gained over two centuries of scientific achievement.

**Purpose:**

We are driven to enrich the lives of those who produce and those who consume, ensuring
progress for generations to come.

**Our Impact:**

**Champion of farmer success**

Farmers are the first to face an ever-changing landscape, while constantly striving for
higher yield, resilience and desirability. They need seeds and crop protection products
that address their challenges—not just by country or region, but laser-focused down to
the acre. We are on the ground alongside them, listening first and then innovating
collaboratively to help enable their success.
Our priority is the success of the farmer—because when producers thrive, our world
thrives.

**A novel approach to innovation**

Ideas don’t live within the confines of a specific industry, sector or technology. It’s why we
apply an open-source philosophy toward innovation, seeking inspiration from a diverse
range of thoughts, ideas and solutions. When combined with our world-class research
and development capabilities, ideas are transformed into reality with groundbreaking and
sustainable agricultural solutions.

**Research and Development discovery and commercialization process**

The path from discovery of a molecule or trait to its introduction to the market is a long
one. Launch is just the halfway point. Post-launch, the Corteva AgriscienceTM Research
and Development team continues to explore different formulations and combinations with
other innovations to meet the ever-changing needs of farmers.

**A responsible food system**

We understand that quality food is the foundation of thriving communities and we work
closely with farmers to ensure that the latest thinking and technology are used to grow
better food, while sustaining the land and conserving resources.
