Hi Everyone, it is our pleasure to announce PyCon India 2018’s platinum sponsor D. E. Shaw India.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

**[D. E. SHAW INDIA PRIVATE LIMITED ("DESIS")](http://www.deshawindia.com/)** is a part of the [D. E. Shaw group](http://www.deshaw.com/), a global investment and technology development firm founded in 1988 with more than $50 billion in investment capital as of April 1, 2018, and offices in North America, Europe, and Asia. The firm has earned an international reputation for successful investing based on innovation, careful risk management, and the quality and depth of their staff. The firm has a significant presence in the world's capital markets, investing in a wide range of companies and financial instruments in both developed and developing economies.

Their culture rewards analytical rigor and adherence to the highest possible ethical and legal standards, and they've cultivated a collegial work environment that promotes collaboration across disciplines, geographies, and investment strategies. The firm has been built in part by attempting to do what other companies might consider impossible, or never imagine at all. A single transformative idea that ultimately works for a new business, a new trading model, or an improved back office process is worth a dozen ideas that lead nowhere. They've learned that when an extraordinary team sets extraordinarily ambitious goals, astonishing breakthroughs can be expected.
