Devsprints ticket are only available to those who have a valid conference ticket. So please use the email id that you used while purchasing the conference ticket.

Due to the limited capacity at the Devsprints venue which can accomodate only about 150 participants, we are taking a nominal amount of fee of INR 100 + GST on the tickets so that people who are really sure about attending the event register themselves. In the past we have seen keeping a plain registration allows people to simply RSVP to the event while the turn up is less than total and people who really wish to attend are left out. So we wanted to make sure people can commit to the event by keeping a nominal fee on the ticket.
