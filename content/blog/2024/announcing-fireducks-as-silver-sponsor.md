Many applications related to data analysis developed using pandas are in high demand for optimization to reduce performance costs, especially when being executed on the cloud. The existing high-performance pandas alternatives sometimes compel a user to learn completely new API syntaxes, whereas some of the others demand paying an extra hardware cost. To address the same, a High-performance Compiler-accelerated DataFrame library, named FireDucks, is developed at NEC R&D Lab. It's a high-performance solution thatâ€™s been crafted for the contemporary data professional who loves pandas and deals with voluminous and complex data on a regular basis. It comes with a multithreaded kernel backend written in C++, an in-built JIT compiler, and a pure python frontend with highly-compatible pandas APIs allowing a native pandas application to be executed as it is without any manual changes. It can simply be installed using pip and with the promise of highly compatible pandas APIs and the revved-up performance, it can serve the demands of this digital age and transform the arduous task of data wrangling into a more efficient and less taxing endeavor.
