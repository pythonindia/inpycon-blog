The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers. The majority of the PSF's work is focused on empowering and supporting people within the Python community. The PSF has active grant programs that support sprints, conferences, meetups, user groups, and Python development efforts all over the world. In addition, the PSF underwrites and runs PyCon US, the primary Python community conference. Being part of the PSF means being part of the Python community. Recently we changed the PSF to an open membership organization, so that everyone who uses and supports Python can join. To learn more, visit <https://www.python.org/psf/membership>.

Follow them on their social media channels [X](https://x.com/ThePSF) and read more on their [website](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/).

We are immensely grateful to PSF for their generous support.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates!
