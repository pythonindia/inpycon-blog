Summary: Here's your chance to put your organization in the limelight of the Python community by sponsoring the largest Python conference in India.

While the PyCon India team is going full speed ahead to make [PyCon India 2024](https://in.pycon.org/2024/) an amazing conference and a great experience for everyone. We bring to you an amazing opportunity for your brand and company to shine and represent themselves at the forefront of the Python India community.

The entire organizing team and the Python community at large are extremely thankful to all the sponsors for supporting the conference throughout the years. Without the support of our sponsors, it wouldn't have been possible to make the conference bigger, better, and more accessible for everyone year after year. Let us take you through why sponsoring PyCon India 2024 would be beneficial for your organization:

## Put your business in the spotlight

Increase your brand exposure and elevate your business identity within the Python community. It is your chance to stand out among the conference attendees by prominently displaying your products and marketing material.

## Give Back to the Community

Establish your goodwill with the community and show the community you’re a reliable partner, willing to support the ecosystem and help it thrive in such challenging times. Sponsorship is a way of giving back to the community and thanking them for their support. Your sponsorship helps PyCon India make the conference affordable and accessible to the widest possible audience.

## Low-Cost Marketing

Instead of spending a fortune on traditional advertisements, take a look at our reasonably priced sponsorship slabs and pick one - letting you be discovered and known to the diverse and widespread Python community at maybe half (or even less!) of your marketing budget.

## Hiring and Business Opportunities

Get matched with folks who could become your next potential clients or employees. The conference has a history of attracting smart folks and businesses from various backgrounds. Get connected, make your pitch, and find the best programmers or clients to join your organizations!

## Flexibility

A sponsorship is a two-way partnership; we want both parties to be happy and gain something from this opportunity. If you have something specific you require from us, please don’t hesitate to ask! We are more than happy to work with you and tailor the sponsorship benefits to suit your needs.

## Startup Slab

Are you a newly established startup or a small business that wants to give back to the community, but cannot justify the price slabs? Don't worry, to make PyCon India affordable to small businesses and startups, we are providing a special 50% discount on  **Associate Sponsorship** slab, just for you. This slab is applicable for organizations with less than 15 employees or less than 3 years in operation.
