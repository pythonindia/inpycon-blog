I am the creator and ongoing maintainer of dozens of Python projects, with millions of users. Most prominently calibre, the e-book management program and kitty, the GPU accelerated terminal. Many of my Python projects are focused speed, for example html5-parser which is 30x as fast as the Python alternatives. Or kitty which has best in class performance despite being written partly in Python.
