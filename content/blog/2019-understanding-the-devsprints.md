## What is a Devsprint?

Devsprints are two days of intensive learning and development on an
open source project of your choice, in a team environment. It's a time
to come together with friends, old and new, to share what you've
learned and apply it to an open source project.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Has contributing to Open source projects been one of those plans for
you that just remained a plan? Or did you try contributing to an Open
source project but got lost somewhere in the middle due to lack of
guidance? Well, Devsprints are here to save the day! During
Devsprints, Mentors/Contributors of Open source projects guide
participants through everything, from generating the development build
to submitting a patch for a bug or improve the project's
documentation.

PyCon India provides the space and infrastructure (network, power,
tables & chairs); you bring your skills, humanity, and brainpower (oh!
and don't forget your laptop).

## Who can participate?

***You!*** It doesn’t matter if you are a newbie or an experienced
contributor, just dive in and get to work. Newbies sit with gurus, go
out for lunch and dinner together, and have a great time while
advancing their project. It is also a great opportunity to understand
and experience the ways of the open source. Although, there will be
situations when you might feel stuck, but there is nothing to worry
about as the mentors present there can provide you instant help to get
you moving. We can say this from experience, that participants of
these Devsprints have not been limited to their open source
contribution just for the conference days.They are still active
contributors. You can purchase Devsprints ticket
[here](https://in.pycon.org/2019/).

## Who can run a Devsprint?

***You!*** If you are a contributor or have been involved in the
maintenance of any Open source project place, please come forward. You
can submit your proposal for your Devsprints [here](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/devsprint-2019/proposals/). This project can be
any interesting open source project which is based on Python. You
should have enough contributions to the project. Your responsibility
will be to help your team set up their development environment, list
out beginner friendly bugs and guide them on any problems. Don't
hesitate to submit your proposals. Any maintainer is welcome to add a
project. PyCon India is open for everyone.
