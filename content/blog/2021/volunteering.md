Summary: Want to give back to the Python community? Here’s an awesome opportunity for you to do it with the year's premier Python conference, **PyCon India 2021**.

[PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/2021/) is a grass-roots, volunteer-driven conference. What that means is every year for the past 12 years, Python communities across the nation have come together to help plan, organize, manage, and run the conference. The conference is operated entirely by volunteers from planning to finding the speakers to managing call for proposals to handling the mega event successfully without fail.

## Things you should know before volunteering

Before you volunteer to help the community make the conference even more amazing, there are a few things you should know:

* There is a lot of work that goes into a conference, and all of it is done by the volunteers. So, naturally, volunteering requires a lot of time and effort, and some activities like running outreach and social media, building content, and finding speakers, a lot more than others. So, make sure you can allocate sufficient time to your volunteering efforts.


* If you are engaged in a volunteering activity while a session is going on, you might not be able to attend that session. If someone needs your assistance with a task, you need to be there. So, plan your conference schedule accordingly.


* Volunteering does not provide you a free way into the event. At PyCon India, everyone needs to buy a ticket, even the organizers. We volunteer because we love the Python programming language and the community, and want to make this event great, not to get a free pass to the conference.

__Workgroup__ - Group of people responsible for the execution of specific tasks focused on a particular aspect of the conference mandated for a given team. The workgroup is also responsible for setting guidelines on the team's working.

__Volunteers__ - The workgroup, along with its volunteers, execute various tasks as agreed within the workgroup. Each Workgroup consists of several volunteers who assign each other tasks, complete the assigned tasks, and help manage the group.

## What do you get out of it?

You might be wondering, what will you get out of helping us make the event better? What will you gain for providing the conference hours of your time?

Other than having an insight and say into the decisions and the direction of the conference you will be attending, there are also some other benefits to volunteering too.

You will get to meet many exceptional people, many of whom are recognized experts in their field. Along with the industry leaders and experts, you will also get to meet a plethora of new people who are working in Python and other open source communities. Some of them might even be developers and contributors to the software you use, and you’ll get to interact with them and get some insights into the development process.

You will also get first-hand, practical experience in managing an event, working with a team, and the open-source development ecosystem. You will get to learn how large-scale, real-life projects work, and what is it like being an important component of the massive machinery behind all the community events. You will get the chance to work alongside some amazing people, from whom you can get to learn a lot if you’re willing to learn.

## What’s expected from conference volunteers

All the aspects of the conference are managed by the volunteers. There are a variety of workgroups you can volunteer for:

* Program WG
    - Talks
    - DevSprints
    - Workshops
* Code of Conduct WG
* Communications WG
    - Design
    - Content
    - Social Media
    - Outreach
* Diversity WG
* Finance & Tickets WG
* Mentorship & Editorial WG
* Platform WG
* Review Panel
* Sessions WG
* Support WG
* Technology WG


We don’t have any specific requirements for our volunteers. Any contributions to any area of the conference which will make the event better are welcome. If you need any help with any work, feel free to reach out to any of us at our [Zulip channel](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/).

All the workgroup leaders and volunteers have a weekly meeting to brief about the progress in their respective workgroup so that everyone's on the same page.

### The Shadow Program

The shadow program is meant to be a way to mentor volunteers to take up the workgroup/conference chair role for the subsequent conference cycles. It is like  an apprenticeship model.

Shadows for a workgroup are expected to devote more time to their workgroup and have to be there when needed. They are expected to be a workgroup lead for later conferences.

You can read more about the program on the [PyCon India Navigator](https://in.pycon.org/navigator/2021/shadow.html).
