PyCon India brings opportunities to get together, share , interact with awesome pythonistas, learn while having fun and get inspired. To trigger an exchange of viewpoints among experts and to create interesting discussions for the community we have planned a few panel discussions.   

Cybersecurity is one of those areas which is picking up big time. As per the reports, there is a huge amount of skill shortage in this area. The one thing that can help fill this gap is diversity.
