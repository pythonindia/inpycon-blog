Summary: The CFP for BoFs and poster presentation sessions for PyCon India 2021 is now open until June 27!!

At [PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/2021/), we keep trying to find new and interactive ways for participants to learn, discuss and interact with each other.  At this year's conference, we will be having Birds of a Feather(BoF) and poster presentation sessions along with our regular talks.

## BoF Sessions

Birds of a Feather sessions (or BoFs) are informal gatherings of like-minded individuals who wish to discuss a certain topic without a pre-planned agenda. BoFs provide an inclusive and informal environment in which participants can share ideas freely. BoFs can be serious, and a great way to gather the people from the community in a common space to deep dive on a topic, but they can also bring opportunities to learn while having a lot of fun!

PyCon India 2021 being an online event BoFs will be in the form of informal or relaxed panel discussions with active participation from the audience.

The proposer of the session will act as moderator and start the session. The moderator will ensure that the discussion is both guided and cohesive and will encourage audience participation. We would like to invite the community for ideas and moderators for BoF topics. Please include a small description of the BoF and possible panelists in the proposal. The duration of a BoF would be _60 minutes_.

## Poster Presentation Sessions

At PyCon India we create opportunities to present/share ideas, topics, or projects (large and small). Poster Presentation provides such an opportunity to have one-to-one interaction with fellow Pythonistas.

Posters are a graphical summary of projects or ideas. They are usually presented with an A0 size poster, but any creative ways are always welcome. The poster session provides an opportunity to network with the conference attendees and acts as a starting point for further discussions. While talks generally need to appeal to a wide section of the community, posters can cover niche topics.

This year, the conference being online, poster presentation will be done with a pre-recorded video of 5-10 minutes which will be followed by a short Q & A session. . The proposer will also submit a poster (in pdf) in their proposal which can be shared with the audience.
