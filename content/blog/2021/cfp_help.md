Summary: Announcing PyCon India Mentorship team's resources, contact links, and weekly calls for first-time speakers as well as veterans.

Do you wish to submit a proposal to PyCon India 2021 but cannot figure out the flow of your talk or how to present it?

Do you have that one lighting topic that can make the Pythonists feel awesome? (Silicon Valley Fans, Assemble!)

Did you solve anything great in Python recently and think it would be great to share it with others?

You have been working in Python for years and interested in presenting your first conference talk?

We know it's not always easy to find the right words when you have something to share. It happens to the best of us. But no need to worry, we’ve all been there. The PyCon India mentorship team is here to help you out with your proposal. Whether you are submitting a proposal at PyCon India for the first time or you are a veteran speaker with years of experience behind you, our mentorship team will guide you through the process and help you wherever required in a number of ways as mentioned below. We want to help you put your best foot forward when it comes to submitting proposals!

You can always contact our mentors on Zulip. You can join them on the [PyCon India Zulip Channel](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/#) and drop a text in the [pre-cfp-21 topic](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/245487-wg.2Fmentorship/topic/pre-cfp-21) of the #wg/mentorship stream (Streams are available to choose from the sidebar on the left).

### **Open Mentorship calls**

In the hopes of providing better opportunities and assistance for first-time speakers at PyCon India 2021, we are starting weekly mentorship calls. This would be an open call for participants and potential speakers to interact with PyCon India mentors to review, share, and discuss draft proposals. Details of the call are as follows:

* **Date:** Weekly on Saturdays
* **Time:** 15:00 to 17:00 IST
* **Platform:** Google Meet - Join with the [invite link](https://meet.jit.si/PyConIndia21Mentorship)

This way you can interact with the mentorship team instantly and clear out queries on a more real-time basis.

### **Reviewing Proposals**

Whichever platform you choose to opt for interacting with the mentors, you would be asked to share a Google document with comment access to a mentor, who will then review and help you polish the draft. If you don't get any response in 48 hours, please send a follow up message to [#wg/mentorship](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/245487-wg.2Fmentorship/topic/pre-cfp-21) on Zulip. And that’s all you need to do.

Hope this helps in the process of framing a proposal and make it easier for you to apply for a talk at PyCon India. After all, PyCon India is a community-driven event and our foremost priority is to help you learn and grow. So, keep your worries aside and just keep on submitting them proposals. If you need any help, we are just a text away!

P.S. Looking forward to reading your proposal.
