Summary: PyCon India 2021 releases the schedule with a schedule packed with 28 talks, six workshops, four keynotes, and many more events for its next online iteration this year!

2021 has been a rollercoaster for all of us, as was 2020. Our team has been working tirelessly to bring you PyCon India's next iteration. And, what a ride it has been for all of us, helping to make PyCon India 2021 a huge success. With the experience gained of organizing a mega event like PyCon India 2020. We are coming back this year with an even bigger, more diverse PyCon India than ever before.

We thank everyone who submitted their ideas for talks, workshops, and poster sessions being organized this year. The call for proposals is a critical aspect of the conference, and we got over 150 submissions! The review committee, along with all the volunteers, worked quite hard to make the deadlines work. All these efforts go on to accomplish one outcome. An incredible PyCon India keeping you at its epicenter!

As we are releasing the schedule for talks, workshops and keynotes, be sure to look out for the agenda for many more events in the coming days on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pyconindia) and on [our mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/inpycon). Our rehearsal team is working double-time to get all the speakers in top shape for making this year's PyCon India a fantastic experience for everyone.
