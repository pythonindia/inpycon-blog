From all of us at the PyCon India team, we wish you've had a safe and prosperous year. As thrilling as 2020 was, we were delighted to see people's response to [PyCon India 2020](https://in.pycon.org/2020).

We are very excited to announce that [**PyCon India**](https://in.pycon.org/) is back for the year 2021. The 13th iteration of the mega-conference will be organized online.

Get ready for four days of non-stop fun and learning with four conference tracks, multiple sessions, BOFs, community booths, workshops, and devsprints.

Assessing the situation with COVID-19 and the rate of vaccination, we have decided to keep PyCon India 2021 as an online event to ensure the safety of everyone involved. We know folks were excited to meet everyone in person and celebrate Python in the "real world" by having an offline PyCon India 2021. We do too but maintaining everyone's health and safety is our utmost priority at all times.

## Dates

The conference will be held from September 16th to 19th, 2021.

* Conference Days: September 16 and 17
* Workshops: September 18
* Devsprints: September 18 and 19

**Ticket sales will be going live on April 15, 2021.**

**The format for devsprints is still being planned and can be changed anytime before the conference.**

## Platform

From the feedback received from the attendees, we have decided to use [Hopin](https://hopin.com/) as the platform to organize the conference again.

Along with Hopin, our communication platform for the conference will be [Zulip](https://zulip.com/). Feel free to join the [PyCon India Zulip channel](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/) anytime, if you want to stay updated regarding the conference.

## Call for Proposals

We will be starting our call for proposals soon.  In case you are excited about teaching or talking about Python, no matter whether you started recently or have been using Python for a decade, make sure you put in a talk proposal. No one became an expert in a day - neither at presenting nor at programming. So don't be shy and don't think too much, just put in a proposal.

* CFP Opens: First week of March 2021
* CFP Closes: 15th May 2021

## Sponsorship and Community Partners

This year, the team has collectively decided to not take any sponsorships to improve the logistics and organization of PyCon India 2021.

We are looking forward to the support from the various Python communities across India joining hands to help us prepare, organize, and manage the mega-conference this year!

Looking forward to meeting you all during the conference.

**PyCon India 2021 Team**
