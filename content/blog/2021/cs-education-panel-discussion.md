Summary: The details are here for the CS Education panel discussion that will be happening at **PyCon India 2021**.

We all are intimately familiar with the advances Computer Science is making on tech, business frontiers, and many aspects of our lives.

Countries worldwide are adding computing to their school curricula and are making extra efforts in broadening access to it.  The school children, working adults, and the elderly are using computers in ever more sophisticated ways.  Therefore computer science education has become an urgent issue, sitting at the intersection of technology and human life.

This year at PyCon India, we're putting together a panel of people who have been working in this area and giving them a forum to discuss the topic. The panel will consist of 4 experts and a moderator on the stage. They will discuss important facets of CS education. Questions will be selected in advance to guide the discussion, and there will be an open Q/A session at the end.

- **Date**: 18 September 2021
- **Time**: 15:30 to 16:30

The participants for the panel will be:
