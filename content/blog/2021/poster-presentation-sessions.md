Slug: poster-presentation
Summary: The  Poster Presentation session details are out for this year's premier Python conference, **PyCon India 2021**.


At PyCon India we create opportunities to present/share ideas, topics, or projects (large and small). Poster Presentation provides such an opportunity to have a one-to-one interaction.

A poster is a  graphical summary of projects or ideas. The poster session provides an opportunity to network with the conference attendees and acts as a starting point for further discussions. While talks generally need to appeal to a wide section of the community, posters can cover niche topics.


At this year's event, we have poster submissions from diverse topics. Students and Pythonistas working in various fields are going to present posters highlighting the use of python in their work. We have some interesting stuff, real-world applications from predicting diabetes to automatic stub-generation tools, being presented in these sessions.

This being an online event, poster presentation will be done with a recorded session of 5-10 minutes.  There will be separate sessions created on the Hopin platform for each poster. The participants can visit these any time during both the days of the conference and leave their feedback/questions. 
Speakers will be available for Q&A Session during the break time on day 2 (19th September).

We invite everyone to visit these sessions and interact with the speakers. Some of them are students and first-time speakers. Your feedback, guidance, and words of appreciation would mean a lot for these newbies in the Python world. 

_See you at Pycon India 2021._
