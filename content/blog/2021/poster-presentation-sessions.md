Summary: The poster presentation session details are out for this year's premier Python conference, **PyCon India 2021**.

At PyCon India we create opportunities to present/share ideas, topics, or projects (large and small). Poster presentations provides a unique opportunity to have a one-to-one interaction to do just that.

A poster is a graphical summary of projects or ideas. The poster session provides an opportunity to network with the conference attendees and acts as a starting point for further discussions. While talks generally need to appeal to a wide section of the community, posters can cover niche topics.

At this year's event, we have poster submissions from diverse topics. Students and Pythonistas working in various fields are going to present posters highlighting the use of Python in their work. This year, ideas randing from predicting diabetes to automatic stub-generation tools are being presented in these sessions.

PyCon Inda 2021 being an online event, a poster presentation will be done with a recorded session of 5-10 minutes. There will be separate sessions created on the Hopin platform for each poster. The participants can visit these any time during both the conference days and leave their feedback/questions. Speakers will be available for Q&A Session during the break time on day 2 of the conference (19th September).

## Session Details

- **Platform/Stage**: Hopin Sessions
- **Date**: 18th and 19th September 2021
