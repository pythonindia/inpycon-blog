Summary: PyCon communities are coming together to organize a series of mega meetups as a precursor to PyCon India 2021

[PyCon India 2021](https://in.pycon.org/2021/) is just a few months away. As a precursor, Python communities across India are coming together to organize a series of mega meetups called PyFlames 2021.

It's a show of unity from all local Python meetup groups and it will be a series of unique events wherein people from different parts of India would come together to join a common meetup and learn more about their favorite aspects of Python.

## The first PyFlames

_The first PyFlames 2021 will be conducted on **May 8, 2021**._

The event will have 3 hours of interesting and insightful talks on Python followed by PyCon India Office Hours where the PyCon India team will be answering any questions you might have regarding the conference this year.
