Summary: PyCon India 2021 is looking for talks to be presented at the conference. Read on to know when submitting a proposal how you too can make your talk awesome. 

PyCon India is the largest gathering of Pythonistas in India for the Python programming language. The 13th edition of PyCon India will be taking place online from 17th September to 20th September 2021. So, whether you are someone submitting a proposal for talks for the first time or just want to share what you have been up to with Python for a long time. This is YOUR time to shine!

We are looking forward to seeing beginner, intermediate, and advanced proposals on diverse topics from speakers of different expertise, and experience. To a submit a proposal, you don’t need to be a veteran who has spoken at a dozen conferences in the past. For making our conference truly diverse, we are looking for all kinds of people. That’s what our community is comprised of, and that’s what this conference’s schedule should be truly made out of. As you think about your experiences, skills, and knowledge that you would want to bring to the table. We also want you to focus on the proposal that you will be submitting to us. A well-thought-out proposal could mean a chance for it to be selected and presented at PyCon India 2021. Take your time to go through our team's advice on preparing a kickass proposal that turns heads (virtually):

1. **Know the deadlines, follow the Deadlines.** 

Unlike other iterations of the event, this year we are determined to stick to deadlines that have been enforced and try to provide minimal extensions. Hence, please make note of some important dates as mentioned below:

- CFP opens on **5th March 2021**
- CFP closes on **7th May 2021**
- Schedule shall be released on **Last week of July**
- Talks will be presented online on **18th and 19th September 2020**

Try to follow the deadlines, and don't miss out on submitting the proposal in the first place. Start with [drafting your proposal]((https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2021/proposals/create/)) today.

2. **Just like variable names, titles are important** 

Give your talk a name that accurately describes the focus of that session in regards to potential attendees. Title is going to be the one line elevator pitch for your talk. This is going to be your first impression for both selection committee and audience. Your title will be listed with hundreds of proposals from various speakers when selection committee goes through them, even though selection doesn't solely depend on the title of the talk but remember, first impression is the best impression. Your title will be also listed along with all the talks on the conference day for the audience to go through. They are going to decide which track to attend based on your title. Some of them from last year being, 

1. Under and Dunder - Python secret functions
2. Taking a peek under the hood - Interpreting black box models
3. How I built a Ray Tracer in Pure Python
4. So, You Want to Build an Anti-Virus Engine?
5. Developing a Single-Sign-On Service using Django
6. Logging the right way!
7. Meme Saheb - Using Dank Learning to Generate Original Meme Captions

3. **Documentation is important, so is the Description** 

A brief description of the talk is needed here. Do provide as much detail as you can to guide us through your plans to cover the topic. The talk duration needs to be 30 minutes. Hence, a rough timeline detailing how you will be spending time explaining the concept would be a great idea to start with. Keep your description elaborate. It should state the problem, how you are trying to solve the problem and what are the take away for the audience. Remember, description is the part where you can convince the selection team that you know what you are talking about.

Also, to make it better you can add an outline section at end of the description. Outline should list out the topics you cover in the talk and roughly how much time you are going to take to deliver them.

4. **Getting the Audience Level right**

At what level of Python and other topic-specific experience or expertise is the talk aiming for? We realize this may be too narrow for a talk, for example, if the talk is aimed at experienced programmers but novices to Python, but give it your best shot. Reviewers need to know what level of Python experience is targeted and also what level(s) of domain-specific expertise is targeted, for example, networking, SQL, database, etc. Please also add references or requirements if any in regards to your talk that attendees need to take care of before joining in.

5. **Propose early and be worry free!**

This year, we will be starting the review process as the proposals come in, and not at the end. Proposals submitted early will get more attention from the reviewers who would be able to provide you the right feedback. 

6. **Don't forget about the COC**

Take a look at the Code of Conduct (COC), and be mindful of it. The gist is, be nice and avoid using sexist language.

7. **Adding the video and making it even better**

The more details you add to your proposal, you will bring more clarity to the selection committee. If you have your slides ready, don't hesitate to attach them to the proposal. It need not be complete, just a skeleton would also do.

Please try take a casual 2 minute video if possible and link it to the proposal. Check the [guidelines for making the video](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2021/proposals/) before hitting the record button. The video will showcase your presentation style and increases the odds of your proposal getting selected.

You can check out a sample proposal outline [here](https://github.com/pythonindia/junction/wiki/Sample-Proposal-Outline).

8. **Talking about Promotional content**

The talk content should not look promotional. If you're talking about a commercialized project (including an open sourced one), make it sufficiently generic. Cover the alternatives and the flip-sides. Make the language neutral and objective. For example, instead of - 'Simplified infrastructure using AWS Lambda', try something like 'Simplified Infrastructure using function as a service, a comparative study across AWS, Azure and GCP'
