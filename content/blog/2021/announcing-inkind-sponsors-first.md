Summary: We are happy to announce some of our InKind Sponsors for PyCon India 2021!


The PyCon India team previously decided to have no sponsors for this year's conference. You can read more about that in our [announcement blog](https://in.pycon.org/blog/2021/pycon-india-announcement.html). 

But, due to popular demand, we have decided to have some InKind sponsors to improve our attendees' experience of the conference from home. 

We are very excited to announce  IBM Quantum, <span>Fulfil.IO</span>, and DeepSource as our first 3 In-Kind sponsors.
