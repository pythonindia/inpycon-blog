Summary: There have been a few changes to the dates and structure of the conference for PyCon India 2021.

We had recently announced [PyCon India 2021](https://in.pycon.org/blog/2021/pycon-india-announcement.html).

But a few aspects of the conference were still being planned and discussed when we made the announcement.

After considering all the factors, the team has decided to change the conference dates to September 17th to 20th, 2021.

The conference structure will now be as follows:

* Workshop: September 17th, 2021  
* Conference: September 18th and 19th, 2021  
* Devsprints: September 20th, 2021  

Please plan your weekend accordingly for an optimal conference experience.

We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this and hope to see you all at the conference.
