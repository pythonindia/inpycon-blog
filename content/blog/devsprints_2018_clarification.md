We have been receiving few queries about Dev Sprints, so this blog clarifies most of such queries and doubts, please read the other [blog](https://in.pycon.org/blog/2018/devsprints-ticket-are-open.html) we posted for Dev sprints before this, if you haven't yet.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

**Ques** - Why should I register for Dev Sprints?<br />
**Ans** - Given the limited capacity of **150** at the venue and to manage the logistics dev sprint attendees hence we have opened registrations for dev Sprint.

**Ques** -  Open source contributions are generally free. Why dev sprint tickets are paid?<br />
**Ans** - We wanted to give the serious people a certain chance to attend the Dev Sprint given the limited capacity. Based on our previous experience of free sponsored workshop tickets, we thought a nominal fee of Rs. **100 + GST** would discourage casual registrations. This also facilitates a fair chance for people who are willing to commit their time and effort towards open source contribution.

**Ques** - How are the Dev Sprint tickets released?<br />
**Ans** - We have opened only **50%** of dev sprint tickets on 29th September. As we expected,  all ticket were sold out within 24 hours. The remaining **50%** of tickets would be opened on the second day of the conference **7th Oct, 11:00 a.m.**
The rationale for opening **50%** tickets later: Considering the limited capacity at the venue, we wanted to give equal opportunity to everyone willing to attend dev sprints.
