Xapo is a fast-growing, global fintech company building a way for users all over the world to send, receive, spend, and store their money globally and safely. We're firm believers that no matter who you are or where you're from, you deserve easy access to digital financial services.

Launched in 2014 by Wences Casares (CEO) & Federico Murrone (COO), Xapo has made an unparalleled investment in security infrastructure, assembled a renowned advisory board, and raised $40M from top venture capital firms in Silicon Valley & the world.

Today, we are a fully distributed team of 250+ Xapiens working from 50+ countries. At Xapo, we embrace our differences and actively foster an inclusive environment where we all can thrive. We're a flexible, family friendly environment, and we recognize that everyone has commitments outside of work. We have a goal of reaching gender parity and strongly encourage women to apply to our open positions. Diversity is not a tagline at Xapo; it is our foundation.
